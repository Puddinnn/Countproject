# Countproject
This is the project that I was in a internship. This project provide a front-back end combined website that will visualise the data we collect from the sensor.
The whole project is based on the asp.net and C#. </br>
I was helped by Mr. Chen a lot. Now I upload it in case not to delete the project.
